# Women in Data Science (Kaggle Survey 2017-2021)

This is a survey analysis for 2017-2021 Kaggle survey. Demographic information (gender, education, country, industry) is plotted here and we studied pay gap among gender and countries. 

The survey results showed that:

- Women are generally underrepresented in the data science community, with less than 20% of participation in all data-related jobs.

- From 2017 to 2021, the average compensation of women dropped from 91% to 71% of menâ€™s, indicating a worsening gender pay gap in the data science field.

- The median compensation of women is only 9% of men in 2020, and is now 54% in 2021. In 2017 & 2018, the median wage used to be very close to men and women.

- Across all educational levels, women earn less than men, with a median wage ranging from 40% to 55% that of men.

- However, the higher the degree is, the higher percentage women take, and the narrower the gap becomes.

- Across different professions, women working as developer advocates and researchers earn more than men. Women working as software development engineers only earn a 36.7% median wage compared to their male counterparts.

- Among all countries, the higher-earning the job, the fewer women.

- Compared by median wage in 2021, women in India earn 27% of that of men, women in the USA earn 85% that of men, women in China earn 71% that of men.

- The severity of the gender pay gap does not necessarily follow a developed/ developing country pattern. Sometimes, countries that achieved higher gender equality according to other international indexes have a larger wage gap in the data science community.

- Gender may or may not be the most important factor determining yearly income, but the gender pay gap is REAL and is getting worse over the years.
